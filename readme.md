> ## Data
> We use multiple sources for populating our database, including BGP, RIR, ISP
> and data sharing agreements, geofeeds and latency-based tracking.
> For some IP ranges we fallback to GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from www.maxmind.com

> ## Information We Collect
> **APIs and SDKs**: We automatically collect certain technical information whenever requests are made to our APIs or applications use our SDKs, including (a) IP address, (b) device and browser information, (c) operating system, (d) the content of the request, (e) the date and time of the request, (f) limited usage data, and (g) for our mobile SDKs, limited location data. We delete IP addresses after 30 days. In addition, when a mobile application uses our SDKs, it may send us certain limited location and usage data along with an ephemeral ID. This ephemeral ID changes hourly and we do not associate it or the unprocessed mobile location data with any personally identifying information, including names, permanent IDs, email addresses, IP addresses, or phone numbers. We also collect randomly-generated IDs for the limited purpose of analyzing the use of our APIs and SDKs, including the number of active users. We will delete the randomly generated IDs and the content of requests made to our APIs after 36 months.
