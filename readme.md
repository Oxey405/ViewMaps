‍Account Information: If you sign up for or authenticate into an account with us, we may collect information that you provide to us in connection with setting up the account, such as your username, name, email address and, for an account you authenticate into, role. Further, in the course of using your account, you may provide us with additional information through your communications with us.‍
Payment Information: Payment is required for some of our Services, and we may ask you to provide certain information, including your name, address, email, and credit card information (collectively, “Payment Information”), in connection with processing your transactions. You may update your Payment Information through your account. All credit card processing for our Services is handled directly by our third-party PCI-certified payment provider, Stripe (and any information you provide to Stripe is governed by its privacy policy). Your Payment Information is encrypted and transmitted directly and securely to Stripe via HTTPS, and is not stored on our systems.‍
Information from Third Parties: We may receive information related to your use of our Vendor websites and services, including your username, name, email address, shipping address and your interaction with our Vendor. Common examples include signing up for an event or requesting shipment of a product from us. From time to time, we may also receive contact enrichment information from third parties.
Website Logs and Cookies: Whenever you visit or interact with our website, we automatically collect certain information about your browser and your interaction with our website, including (a) IP address, (b) browser and device type, (c) operating system, (d) referring web page, (e) the date and time of page visits, and (f) the pages accessed on our websites. We also use cookies and similar technologies to recognize and improve your use of our websites and, for accounts a user authenticated into, to retain records associated with each user, and you will not be able to access certain parts of our websites, including those that require a login, unless your device accepts cookies from us. You can find out more information about the cookies on our website and managing your browser’s cookie preferences for our website here.
APIs and SDKs: We automatically collect certain technical information whenever requests are made to our APIs or applications use our SDKs, including (a) IP address, (b) device and browser information, (c) operating system, (d) the content of the request, (e) the date and time of the request, (f) limited usage data, and (g) for our mobile SDKs, limited location data. We delete IP addresses after 30 days. In addition, when a mobile application uses our SDKs, it may send us certain limited location and usage data along with an ephemeral ID. This ephemeral ID changes hourly and we do not associate it or the unprocessed mobile location data with any personally identifying information, including names, permanent IDs, email addresses, IP addresses, or phone numbers. We also collect randomly-generated IDs for the limited purpose of analyzing the use of our APIs and SDKs, including the number of active users. We will delete the randomly generated IDs and the content of requests made to our APIs after 36 months.‍
Vision SDK: We automatically collect certain information whenever the Vision SDK is in use, including (a) IP address, (b) device and browser information, (c) operating system, (d) the content of the API requests, (e) the date and time of the request, (f) limited location and usage data, (g) limited front-facing camera imagery and video, (h) a randomly generated ID, (i) accelerometer data and (j) detected road feature data.‍
Hosted Data: In using your account, you may upload data to us via Mapbox Studio, Mapbox Studio Classic, our Dataset API or our Upload API ("Hosted Data") so that Mapbox can host it for you as part of providing our Services. We delete Hosted Data upon your request, however, due to our highly available, distributed implementation of our hosting solution, artifacts of Hosted Data may remain on Mapbox systems after you delete the file in your account. We will delete those artifacts in accordance with our standard platform maintenance practices after we either receive a specific request from you to delete the Hosted Data artifacts (along with sufficient information to identify which data you want to ensure are deleted) or we receive a request from you to delete your account.‍
Feedback: You and/or your end users may provide us with feedback regarding our Services (e.g., in the form of email, suggestions for how to improve our maps, etc). We do not delete this information.
